I"õ<p>Iâ€™m a geophysicist with a strong interest image processing for detection of natural resources in the subsurface and spatially mapping their distribution. My work includes imaging and characterisation of subsurface reservoirs from seismic data. Applications I am interested include process and analyse remote sensing data for anomaly detection using open-source python tools, rock physics modelling and computarised tomography.</p>

<p>Have a look to the geo-data science projects I have worked on in the Project section.</p>

<p>If you want to get to know my artisitc side, visit my gallery where I have photography collections and watercolor paintings.</p>

<p>Thanks for your interest and get in touch as Iâ€™m open for work and collaborations.</p>
