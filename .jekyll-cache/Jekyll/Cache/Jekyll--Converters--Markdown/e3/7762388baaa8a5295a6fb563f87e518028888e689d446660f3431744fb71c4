I"v<p>I’m a geophysicist with a stong interest in the application of machine learning algorithms to enhance imaging technology.</p>

<p>Most of my work have focused on imaging and characterisation of the subsurface by integrating seismic data, rock physics, and geology.</p>

<p>I’m also interested in analysing remote sensing data, e.g., SAR, InSAR, Lidar, for mapping and anomaly detection using open-source python tools.</p>

<p>My potfolio is a work in progress, from past and present projects I’ve worked on, as I build upon my data science skills and I learn about remote sensing applications.</p>
