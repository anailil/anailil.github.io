I"…<p>My work has been focused on quantitative analysis of geophysical and geologic data for detection of natural resources, namely <em>geo-data science</em>. Through numerical modelling and inversion methods, I predict physical properties of rocks in the interior of the Earth or at its surface. It requieres team work to get all this done and expertise in several Earth sciences.</p>

<p>Results driven and motivated by challenges, I teach myself machine learning and <em>remote sensing</em> using free and open resources.</p>

<p>This is a place where I collect these learning experiences.</p>

<p>Thanks for your interest!</p>
