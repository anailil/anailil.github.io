I"½<p>Salt geometry is difficult to image seismically due to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Large velocity contrast</li>
  <li>Steeply dipping  flanks</li>
  <li>Most algorithms assume acoustic (isotropic and homogeneous) media</li>
</ul>

<p>However, observations of natural salt show layering, like this photo from a salt mine in Canada where I conducted fieldwork for my PhD project.</p>

<p>Now, salt is a general term that actually refers to evaporites: sequences of varios evaporitic minerals. Each of these minerals have specific physical properties which determine the geometrical arrangement of crystals if they undergo tectonic stress.</p>

<p>Look at these images from salt diapir outcrops in Nova Scotia shores. These diapirs are mainly of gypsum and show strong crystal alignments or <em>foliation</em>.</p>

<h2 id="hypothesis">Hypothesis</h2>

<p>Seismic images where salt is present are commonly processed under the assumption that salt deposits are mainly of isotropic and homogeneous halite. However, previous studies indicate that anhydrite and layered evaporites may play a bigger role when it comes to identify salt geometry in the subsurface, as shown below (Jackson &amp; Lewis, 2012).</p>

<p>Moreover, geological studies from outcrops provide scale-relevant information to the charcaterisation of rocks in the subsurface according to Jones et al. (2008).</p>

<p>From field observations, I investigated how elastic properties of various salt minerals contribute to the overal properties of <em>salt</em>, under the premises that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Evaporite minerals exhibit intrinsic anisotropy.</li>
  <li>They can arrange in preferred orientations, leading to effective transverse isotropy.</li>
  <li>It is the tectonic stress that can induce transverse isotropy (strain history).</li>
</ol>
