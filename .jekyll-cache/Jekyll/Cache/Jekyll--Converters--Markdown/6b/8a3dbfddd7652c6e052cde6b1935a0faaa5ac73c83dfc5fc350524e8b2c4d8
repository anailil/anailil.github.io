<p>Salt geometry is difficult to image seismically due to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Large velocity contrast</li>
  <li>Steeply dipping  flanks</li>
  <li>Most algorithms assume acoustic (isotropic and homogeneous) media</li>
</ul>

<p>However, observations of natural salt show layering, like this photo from a salt mine in Canada where I conducted fieldwork for my PhD project.</p>

<p>Now, salt is a general term that actually refers to evaporites: sequences of varios evaporitic minerals. Each of these minerals have specific physical properties which determine the geometrical arrangement of crystals if they undergo tectonic stress.</p>

<p>Look at these images from salt diapir outcrops in Nova Scotia shores. These diapirs are mainly of gypsum and show strong crystal alignments or <em>foliation</em>.</p>
