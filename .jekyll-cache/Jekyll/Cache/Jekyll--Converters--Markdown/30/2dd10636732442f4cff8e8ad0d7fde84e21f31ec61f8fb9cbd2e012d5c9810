I"9<p>I’m a geophysicist with a strong interest image processing for detection of natural resources in the subsurface and spatially mapping their distribution. My work includes imaging and characterisation of subsurface reservoirs from seismic data. My professional interests include process and analyse remote sensing data for anomaly detection using open-source python tools.</p>

<p>Have a look to the geo-data science projects I have worked on in the Project section.</p>

<p>Thanks for your interest and get in touch as I’m open for work and collaborations.</p>
