I'm a scientist who likes rocks and make computer models of them. 

Specialised on the integration of geophysical and geologic data to predict physical properties of rocks that lead to the detection of natural resources in the subsurface, namely, *geo-data science*.

Analytical methods I apply to process geophysical data include spatial and spectral signal processing, numerical modelling, inversion, anomaly detection, and 3D mapping aided by classic statistical prediction methods as well as machine learning algorithms. 

Interested in leveraging my skills processing *remote sensing data* and produce high-res images for monitoring Earth's surface resources (e.g., soil, biomass, roads).

Fancy a collaboration? Drop me a message!
