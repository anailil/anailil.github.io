I'm a geophysicist with a stong interest in the application of machine learning algorithms to enhance images for mapping natural resources.

Some of my work focused on imaging and characterisation of the subsurface by integrating seismic data, rock physics, and geology.

Recently, I have focused on imagery using satellite data to create maps of the surface reflectance for natural resources monitoring.
