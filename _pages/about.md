My work has been focused on quantitative analysis of geophysical and geologic data for detection of natural resources, namely *geo-data science*. Through numerical modelling and inversion methods, I predict physical properties of rocks in the interior of the Earth or at its surface. It requieres team work to get all this done and expertise in several Earth sciences. 

Results driven and motivated by challenges, I teach myself machine learning and *remote sensing data* using free and open resources. Because science must be open and free to everyone. 

This is a place where I collect these learning experiences.

Thanks for your interest!
