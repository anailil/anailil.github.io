I'm a geophysicist with a stong interest in the application of machine learning algorithms to enhance imaging technology.

Most of my work have focused on imaging and characterisation of the subsurface by integrating seismic data, rock physics, and geology. 

I'm also interested in analysing remote sensing data, e.g., SAR, InSAR, Lidar, for mapping and anomaly detection using open-source python tools. 

My potfolio is a work in progress, from past and present projects I've worked on, as I build upon my data science skills and I learn about remote sensing applications.
