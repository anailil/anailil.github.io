Salt geometry is difficult to image seismically due to:

- Large velocity contrast 
- Steeply dipping  flanks 
- Most algorithms assume acoustic (isotropic and homogeneous) media

However, observations of natural salt show layering, like this photo from a salt mine in Canada where I conducted fieldwork for my PhD project.

Now, salt is a general term that actually refers to evaporites: sequences of varios evaporitic minerals. Each of these minerals have specific physical properties which determine the geometrical arrangement of crystals if they undergo tectonic stress. 

Look at these images from salt diapir outcrops in Nova Scotia shores. These diapirs are mainly of gypsum and show strong crystal alignments or *foliation*.

## Hypothesis

Seismic images where salt is present are commonly processed under the assumption that salt deposits are mainly of isotropic and homogeneous halite. However, previous studies indicate that anhydrite and layered evaporites may play a bigger role when it comes to identify salt geometry in the subsurface, as shown below (Jackson & Lewis, 2012).

Moreover, geological studies from outcrops provide scale-relevant information to the charcaterisation of rocks in the subsurface according to Jones et al. (2008).

From field observations, I investigated how elastic properties of various salt minerals contribute to the overal properties of *salt*, under the premises that: 

1. Evaporite minerals exhibit intrinsic anisotropy.
2. They can arrange in preferred orientations, leading to effective transverse isotropy.
3. It is the tectonic stress that can induce transverse isotropy (strain history).

## Research set up

This was a multi-scale study that includes:
1. Field work, from which the geometry of diapirs was measured from diapir outcrops, including the deformation style of the overlaying rock sequences.
2. Laboratory tests, including ultrasonic velocity measurements, microscopic studies to model preferred orientation and elastic properties of salt 
3. Numerical modelling, to determine velocity anisotropy and account for it during seisimc seismic and geomechanical modelling.

### Crystallographic Microstructure

I used a suite of natural evaporite samples of three main lithologies (halite-, anhydrite-, and gypsum-dominated) with strong fabrics, which were collected from a single diapiric province in Nova Scotia, Canada. 

I studied thin sections from all rock samples collected in the field and in the salt mine to study the crystallographic microstructure and model their velocity behavior. Here are some examples from the optical microscope, showing the arrangement and mineral arrangement. These studies also provided insights into the volume fraction of other evaporite mineral within salt deposits.

### Crystallographic Nanostructure

Sample mineralogy and crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) were obtained with the electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) technique.

Then, bulk seismic properties for polymineralic evaporites were evaluated with a rock recipe approach (Volg and Reuss bounds).

### Ultrasonic labt tests
In the laboratory, I did ultrasonic tests on cube shaped samples of the same rock specimens.

## Insights drawn from this study

Results provide insights into the microstructural factors controlling seismic velocities of polymineralic evaporites to better understand the relationship between intrinsic and extrinsic sources of these characteristics.

Crystallographic preferred orientation is responsible for a significant fraction of the bulk seismic velocity anisotropy of the polycrystalline evaporites under study. 

Also, the influence of individual evaporitic minerals on velocity anisotropy depends not only on its modal proportion, but on its individual CPO. 

Variation of seismic velocity anisotropy suggests a mutually destructive relationship between anhydrite and gypsum that, if true, changes the perception that highly anisotropic minerals only enhance anisotropy, when it may also reduce it.

Seismic velocity anisotropy caused by extrinsic sources can be as significant as intrinsic velocity anisotropy, and must be taken into account to characterise seismic velocity anisotropy of evaporites.
